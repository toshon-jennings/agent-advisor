# Runs the fresh final review out-of-process on the Codex CLI, so the verdict comes
# from a different vendor than the chair. Every model-affecting setting is pinned
# here rather than inherited: --ignore-user-config means ~/.codex/config.toml cannot
# retarget the review, which is the whole point of the lane.
#
# Usage: review-codex.sh <repo-root> <prompt-file> <out-dir>
#
# Exit codes split unavailability from integrity, because only the first may be
# failed over. An integrity failure means the lane ran and did not do its job, and
# falling back from that would let a caller choose the weaker reviewer on purpose.
#
#   0  review ran, pin held, verdict well-formed
#   2  codex is not installed                     -> FAILOVER permitted
#   3  codex ran and failed (auth, network, quota) -> FAILOVER permitted
#   4  codex ran but did not honor the pin         -> HARD STOP
#   5  codex ran but returned no well-formed verdict -> HARD STOP
#   6  caller error (bad arguments, unwritable out-dir) -> HARD STOP
#
# The reviewed repository is untrusted input, not just data to read. Launching into it
# makes Codex load its AGENTS.md, its .codex/ config, its hooks and its skills as
# instructions, so a change under review could steer its own review. The lane therefore
# runs from an empty scratch directory and reaches the repository by absolute path:
# verified that this keeps full read access while a planted AGENTS.md stops being
# obeyed. --ignore-user-config, --ignore-rules and project_doc_max_bytes=0 close the
# remaining instruction surfaces.

set -uo pipefail

# The lane's pin. Changing these changes the lane, so change them here and nowhere
# else; a caller must not be able to override them per invocation.
